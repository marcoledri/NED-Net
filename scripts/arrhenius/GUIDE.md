# BENDR Pre-training on Arrhenius — Step-by-Step Guide

Arrhenius (NAISS) is the planned replacement for the current
infrastructure. Its GPU partition uses **NVIDIA GH200 superchips**:
a 72-core ARM (aarch64) CPU fused with an H100 GPU and 96 GB of
HBM, four per node, on a single Lustre filesystem.

This guide mirrors the LUNARC one but uses an **NVIDIA NGC PyTorch
container** instead of conda. The container ships a PyTorch build
that is properly compiled for aarch64 + CUDA + the GH200's
NVLink-C2C path, so we don't have to fight pip wheels or wait for
conda-forge to catch up on every release.

## Items confirmed from NAISS docs (2026-06)

The login hostname, GPU partition, project storage convention, and
account-status workflow are now baked into the scripts. Only the
SUPR project ID is still a placeholder — set it once in `_common.sh`
and the `#SBATCH -A` line of each job, then everything else
resolves.

| Item | Value | Where it lives |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Login | `login.hpc.arrhenius.naiss.se` | Step 1 |
| GPU partition | `arrhenius-gpu` | `_common.sh` + `#SBATCH -p` |
| Project storage | `/nobackup/proj/disk/<PROJECT>` (or `…/flash/…`) | `_common.sh` |
| Account status | https://supr.naiss.se/account/ | this guide |
| Project ID | **placeholder** `naiss2026-X-XXX` | `_common.sh` + `#SBATCH -A` |
| Apptainer module | `Apptainer` | `_common.sh` — fall back to `singularity` if `module spider` shows that instead |

## Before you start

- [ ] SUPR allocation approved for Arrhenius
- [ ] LUNARC compute allocation (`LU 2026/2-60`) still active — useful
      as a fallback while Arrhenius onboarding is in progress
- [ ] EDF files staged somewhere transferable (currently on LUNARC at
      `/lunarc/nobackup/projects/lu2026-2-60/edf_data` — copying
      cluster-to-cluster is much faster than re-uploading from your Mac)

---

## Step 1: Log in

Before the first login, confirm your account is "enabled / Active" at
[supr.naiss.se/account/](https://supr.naiss.se/account/). If the
status is still "missing → enabled, transferring", wait — SSH will
fail with `Permission denied (publickey)` until the transfer
completes.

```bash
ssh ledri@login.hpc.arrhenius.naiss.se
```

Fallback login nodes (load-balanced): `arrhenius1.hpc.arrhenius.naiss.se`,
`arrhenius3.hpc.arrhenius.naiss.se`.

---

## Step 2: Upload code to Arrhenius

From your **local machine** (macOS Terminal, Linux, or WSL on Windows):

```bash
rsync -avz --filter=':- .gitignore' --exclude '.git' \
  ~/Software/NED-Net/ \
  ledri@login.hpc.arrhenius.naiss.se:~/NED-Net/
```

From Windows (PowerShell → WSL Ubuntu):

```bash
rsync -avz --filter=':- .gitignore' --exclude '.git' \
  /mnt/c/Users/Marco/Software/NED-Net/ \
  ledri@login.hpc.arrhenius.naiss.se:~/NED-Net/
```

The same SSH ControlMaster setup from the LUNARC guide works here —
just add an entry for `Host arrhenius login.hpc.arrhenius.naiss.se`.

---

## Step 3: Get the EDF data onto Arrhenius

The fastest path is **cluster-to-cluster** rsync over SSH. From
Arrhenius's login node:

```bash
# Replace LUNARC_USER with your LUNARC username
rsync -avz --progress \
  LUNARC_USER@cosmos.lunarc.lu.se:/lunarc/nobackup/projects/lu2026-2-60/edf_data/ \
  $PROJECT_STORAGE/edf_data/
```

`$PROJECT_STORAGE` is set by `_common.sh` (default
`/nobackup/proj/disk/$NAISS_PROJECT`). Resolve it before transfer:

```bash
cd ~/NED-Net
source scripts/arrhenius/_common.sh
echo "Will write to: $PROJECT_STORAGE/edf_data"
mkdir -p "$PROJECT_STORAGE/edf_data"
```

If `mkdir` fails, run `storagequota` on the login node — it lists
the project directories you actually have access to. Update
`PROJECT_STORAGE` in `_common.sh` if the doc-published convention
doesn't match your allocation (e.g. your project only granted the
`flash` tier).

> **No backups.** `/nobackup/proj/...` is, as the name says, not
> backed up. Keep the originals safe elsewhere.

---

## Step 4: Confirm project ID + paths in `_common.sh`

Edit `scripts/arrhenius/_common.sh` once and set:

- `NAISS_PROJECT` — your SUPR ID (e.g. `naiss2026-2-99`)
- `PROJECT_STORAGE` — only override if `storagequota` reports something
  other than `/nobackup/proj/disk/<id>` (e.g. you were granted only
  the flash tier, then use `/nobackup/proj/flash/<id>`)

Every job script and `setup_env.sh` source this file, so this is the
only place you need to edit.

Then update each `.sh` file's `#SBATCH -A naiss2026-X-XXX` line to
match (Slurm reads the account before `_common.sh` runs, so it has
to be inline). Files to touch: `test_gpu.sh`, `test_gpu_tiny.sh`,
`pretrain_short.sh`, `pretrain.sh`, `resume.sh`.

---

## Step 5: Set up the container environment (one-time)

```bash
cd ~/NED-Net
bash scripts/arrhenius/setup_env.sh
```

What this does:

1. Loads the `Apptainer` module
2. Pulls `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.10-py3` (aarch64) into
   `$PROJECT_STORAGE/containers/`
3. Creates a small extras venv at `$PROJECT_STORAGE/venvs/bendr-extras`
   that lives outside the SIF — so updating `pyedflib` or your own
   package later doesn't require re-pulling the container
4. Installs `pyedflib`, `scipy`, `tqdm`, and `eeg_seizure_analyzer`
   into that venv

Expect 10–30 minutes for the pull (the SIF is ~10 GB).

---

## Step 6: Create logs directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/NED-Net/logs
```

`OUTPUT_DIR` and the container directory are created automatically.

---

## Step 7: Quick GPU smoke tests

Run the **tiny** smoke first — it's tuned for 2–9 EDFs and finishes
in well under 30 minutes. If it passes, run the full `test_gpu.sh`
to validate at scale.

### 7a — Tiny test (2–9 EDFs)

Upload 2–9 EDFs to `$PROJECT_STORAGE/edf_data/` (Step 3 commands work
for any subset — point them at a small folder), then:

```bash
cd ~/NED-Net
sbatch scripts/arrhenius/test_gpu_tiny.sh
```

Workers dropped to 2, validation disabled, 3 segments/file.

### 7b — Full-scale test

After the full dataset is uploaded:

```bash
sbatch scripts/arrhenius/test_gpu.sh
```

### Watch either job

```bash
squeue -u $USER                            # job state
tail -f logs/bendr_tiny_<JOBID>.out        # tiny
tail -f logs/bendr_test_<JOBID>.out        # full
```

### What to look for

1. `Arch: aarch64` — confirms ARM kernel/userspace (Grace CPU)
2. `PyTorch 2.x.x, CUDA 12.x` — container layer healthy
3. `Device: NVIDIA H200` (or `GH200`) — GPU detected
4. `EDF files found:` listing — Lustre path correct
5. `Epoch 1/2` … `Epoch 2/2` — training actually runs
6. Checkpoint saved under `$PROJECT_STORAGE/bendr_output/{tiny,test}_run/`

---

## Step 8: Short pre-training (5 epochs)

Same logic as LUNARC: run a short pass on the full dataset before
committing to the long job. The resume script picks up from the
last checkpoint, so this is not wasted compute.

```bash
sbatch scripts/arrhenius/pretrain_short.sh
```

Monitor:

```bash
squeue -u $USER
tail -f logs/bendr_5ep_<JOBID>.out
```

Loss should drop noticeably across the 5 epochs. If it doesn't,
stop and debug before continuing.

---

## Step 9: Continue to 30 epochs

```bash
sbatch scripts/arrhenius/resume.sh
```

Resumes from the latest `checkpoint_epoch_*.pt` in `OUTPUT_DIR`.
If the 7-day walltime hits and 30 epochs aren't done, just submit
`resume.sh` again — it keeps picking up from the latest checkpoint.

Auto-chain after `pretrain_short.sh`:

```bash
JOBID=$(sbatch --parsable scripts/arrhenius/pretrain_short.sh)
sbatch -d afterok:$JOBID scripts/arrhenius/resume.sh
```

---

## Step 10: Download the trained model

```bash
# Best model location
ls $PROJECT_STORAGE/bendr_output/run1/best_model.pt
```

From your **local Mac**:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.eeg_seizure_analyzer/pretrained
scp <YOUR_USERNAME>@<arrhenius-login>:$PROJECT_STORAGE/bendr_output/run1/best_model.pt \
  ~/.eeg_seizure_analyzer/pretrained/bendr_rodent_25k.pt
```

(You can leave it on Lustre and re-use from there if you fine-tune
on Arrhenius too.)

---

## Step 11: Use the pre-trained model in NED-Net

Identical to LUNARC — open the Dash app, go to **Training →
Dataset/Model**, pick **BENDR**, and the `bendr_rodent_25k` weight
file appears in the dropdown.

---

## Why a container, not conda?

- aarch64 PyTorch wheels exist on PyPI (since 2.3) but the
  GH200-specific NCCL tuning and CUDA-12.x driver path is not
  guaranteed to match an arbitrary pip install.
- NVIDIA's NGC PyTorch image is built and tested by NVIDIA for
  exactly this hardware. It's the same recipe their reference
  benchmarks use, so reproducing results later is easier.
- Lustre + many-file workloads benefit from the container's
  consistent libc/NCCL versions across nodes — useful if we ever
  scale to multi-node DDP.

If a future PyTorch release ships a known-good aarch64+GH200 wheel
through conda-forge, we can switch — but the container path is the
zero-surprise option for the first runs.

## Useful commands on Arrhenius

| What | Command |
|------|---------|
| List your jobs | `squeue -u $USER` |
| Cancel a job | `scancel <JOBID>` |
| Storage / project info | `storagequota` |
| Account status | https://supr.naiss.se/account/ |
| Watch a log | `tail -f logs/bendr_*_<JOBID>.out` |
| Estimated start | `squeue --start -j <JOBID>` |
| GPU partition status | `sinfo -p arrhenius-gpu` |
| Inspect container | `apptainer inspect $CONTAINER_PATH` |
| Shell into container | `apptainer shell --nv $CONTAINER_PATH` |
| Interactive GPU shell | `interactive -p arrhenius-gpu --gpus 1 -t 30` |

---

## Troubleshooting

**`apptainer: command not found`**
The module is named differently at this site. Try
`module spider apptainer` and `module spider singularity`. Edit
the `module load Apptainer` line in `_common.sh` and the job
scripts.

**`ERROR: CUDA not visible inside container`**
Check the script used `apptainer exec --nv`. The `--nv` flag is
what mounts the host NVIDIA driver into the container.

**`No checkpoint found`**
`OUTPUT_DIR` doesn't exist or is on a different filesystem than
where the previous job wrote to. Confirm
`echo $PROJECT_STORAGE/bendr_output/run1` resolves to the same path
the previous job logged.

**Job stuck pending**
`squeue --start -j <JOBID>` shows the estimated start. Until NAISS
publishes how Arrhenius prioritises jobs, treat long waits as
normal during the rollout period.

**EDF reader complains about samples < 1**
This was the LUNARC-era bug — fixed in `adicht_reader.py` to handle
records where individual channels are empty. Make sure your code
checkout includes that fix before re-converting on Arrhenius.
